# Conversation-Analysis
Conversational analysis using WhatsApp chat as my dataset<br />

<b>Requirements and how to install them:</b> <br />
<ul>
<li>matplotlib, pip install matplotlib</li>
<li>pandas, pip install pandas</li>
<li>emoji, pip install emoji</li>
<li>seaborn, pip install seaborn</li>
</ul>

<b>Running/Deployment:</b> <br />
Open cmd, go to the directory where you extracted the file and type 'python whatsapp_analyzer.py', then press Enter
Input the directory of the chat you exported from WhatsApp and input the directory where required then press Enter

Since emojis can't be viewed on cmd, just copy the selected emoji and paste it anywhere that emojis can be viewed e.g. a browser and you would see it.
